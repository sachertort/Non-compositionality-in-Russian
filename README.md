# Non-compositionality-in-Russian

Hey, I'm Roma Kazakov. There are different materials of my final qualifying work on the topic "Compositionality Level Judgements across Local Contexts in the Sentence: Human vs. Machine" are stored in this repository. Here is the list:
  * `final_noncomp_dataset.tsv` â€” the main dataset;
  * `statistics.ipynb` - the script for statistics, calculating the kappa, syntactic parsing;
  * `composition.ipynb` - the script with the experiment of semantic composition, using the vector model and linear regression;
  * `kappa_cohen.tsv` - assessments of both annotators for calculating the kappa;
  * `regression_points.tsv` - small sample of predicted estimates by the model.
